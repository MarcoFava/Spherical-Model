# The parameters have to be stored in the following order on a single column:
# dim, L, T_i, T_f, J, H, n_T_steps, theta, n_MC, burnin, out_num.

3           # <int> dim		    --> dimension of the system
7		    # <int> L		    --> leght of the system (N = L^dim)
2           # <double> T_i		--> initial temperature of the simulation
6           # <double> T_f		--> final temperature of the simulation
1           # <double> J        --> Energy of interaction
0           # <double> H        --> Magnetic field
12          # <int> n_T_steps	--> number of temperature steps between T_i and T_f
0.4         # <double> theta    --> metropolis' variable, in radians
50e3       # <int> n_MC		--> number of Markov Chain Monte Carlo cycles
0.65       	# <int> burnin		--> percentage of burn-in time

0          # <int> out_num		--> number to change the name of the output file

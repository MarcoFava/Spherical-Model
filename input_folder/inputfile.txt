# The parameters have to be stored in the following order on a single column (skips after "#"):
# dim, L, T_i, T_f, J, H, n_T_steps, theta, n_MC, burnin, out_num.

3           # <int> dim         --> dimension of the system
5           # <int> L           --> length of the system (N = L^dim)
1           # <double> T_i      --> initial temperature of the simulation
10          # <double> T_f      --> final temperature of the simulation
1           # <double> J        --> Energy strength of interaction
0           # <double> H        --> Magnetic field
16          # <int> n_T_steps   --> number of temperature steps between T_i and T_f
0.4         # <double> theta    --> metropolis' variable, in radians
20e3        # <int> n_MC        --> number of Markov Chain Monte Carlo cycles
0.5         # <int> burnin      --> percentage of burn-in time

11          # <int> out_num     --> number to change the name of the output file
